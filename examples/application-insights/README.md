This example demonstrates how to integrate application insights with a static web app.

## Notes

Hidden-link tags to associate the Application Insights resource with the static web app

This integration is primarily useful when the static web app has function api's attached, as application insights will then collect server-side telemetry. For client-side monitoring, you would add the Application Insights JavaScript SDK directly to your web application code.
